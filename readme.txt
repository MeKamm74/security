This program finds the gcd of two numbers and the linear combination.

With no arguments given, it reads in from default.cfg and outputs to default.log.

The first argument you give will be the path to another input file.
The second argument is the path to a log file. 

The input file just has the first number on the first line and the second on the second line, nothing else.
